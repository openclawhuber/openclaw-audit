## Title
OpenClaw AI Agent Setup, Security & Automation Expert

## Overview
I specialize in **OpenClaw** — the open-source AI agent platform. Whether you're setting up your first bot or hardening a production deployment, I'll get you running securely and efficiently.

**What I offer:**

🔒 **Security Audit** ($75) — Full config review of your OpenClaw installation. I check Telegram DM policies, gateway exposure, auth configuration, group permissions, and model fallbacks. You get a detailed report with exact fixes.

🛠️ **Setup & Hardening** ($250) — Fresh OpenClaw install from scratch. Includes channel configuration (Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp), model auth (Anthropic, OpenAI, local models), security hardening, and deployment verification.

📋 **Monthly Maintenance** ($50/mo) — Ongoing monitoring, config updates when OpenClaw releases new versions, model rotation, and priority support.

🤖 **Custom Automation** ($100-500) — Custom skills, cron jobs, multi-agent setups, browser automation, API integrations, and workflow design.

**Why me:**
- I run OpenClaw 24/7 on dedicated hardware
- Creator of [openclaw-audit](https://github.com/openclawhuber/openclaw-audit), the open-source security checker
- Deep knowledge of the OpenClaw ecosystem: channels, models, nodes, skills, and security
- Fast turnaround (most audits within 24 hours)

**Free resource:** Run my open-source audit tool yourself first:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclawhuber/openclaw-audit/main/openclaw-audit.sh | bash
```
